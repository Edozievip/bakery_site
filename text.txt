Week 15 Reflection: Adding Life to the Bakery Website with JavaScript 🚀

This past week, we dove into JavaScript, and it allowed me to elevate the bakery website I’ve been working on. Using the foundations of HTML and CSS from previous classes, I added interactive features to the webpage, such as dynamic buttons and content updates, to make the user experience more engaging.

It was an exciting opportunity to see how JavaScript can breathe life into a static webpage. Below, you’ll find a screenshot of the code I worked on and the bakery website in action. 🍰

This project was not only fun to build but also a great way to put my learning into practice. Looking forward to continuing this journey and adding even more functionality to my future projects!
